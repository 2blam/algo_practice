    "You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.\n",

    "You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.\n",
