    "Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:\n",
    "- You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.\n",
    "- Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.\n",
    "- At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.\n",
