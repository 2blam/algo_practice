    "The problem provides us with a string ```s``` and an integer ```k```. The task is to repetitively remove k adjacent, identical characters from the string until no further such group of ```k``` identical characters exists. After each removal, the left and right parts of the string are concatenated together. This process of removal is known as a k duplicate removal. The final string obtained after performing as many k duplicate removals as possible is the output. It is assured that the outcome obtained is unique for the given input string and integer ```k```.\n",
