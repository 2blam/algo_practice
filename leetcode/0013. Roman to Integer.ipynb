    "Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not ```IIII```. Instead, the number four is written as ```IV```. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as ```IX```. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n",
